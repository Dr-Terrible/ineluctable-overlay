		Plug n' PLay (PnP) is a Generic plug-in system inspired by Trac's
		(http://trac.edgewall.org) internal component management. With PnP you can
		turn any program into a pluggable software very easily.
		You just have to define the Interfaces and let others implement them. When
		your code is running you can dynamically retrieve who are the classes that
		implement a certain Interface, and call the specific methods.
