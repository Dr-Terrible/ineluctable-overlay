		Dexy is a tool for writing documents which relate to code. This might mean
		software documentation, journal articles relating to computational research,
		a code tutorial on your blog, writing up computer science class assignments,
		pretty much anything. You can think of Dexy as a very fancy 'make' tool with
		lots of document-related features and powerful filters.
