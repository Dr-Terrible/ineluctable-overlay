Files and Folders

“Your Files” or “User Files” (collectively, the “Files”) as used in this
Agreement means the information contained in the files that you or other users
upload, download and access through the Site and Services. You are the owner of
Your Files and are solely responsible for your conduct and the content of Your
Files, as well as any of the content contained in your communications with other
Dropbox users, including but not limited to User Posts (as defined below).

Dropbox allows you to share some or all of Your Files. If you choose to, you can
share all or some of Your Files with the general public, or with specific
individuals you select. If you decide to share Your Files, you are giving
certain legal rights, as explained below, to those individuals who you have
given access to your folders.

Dropbox does not claim any ownership rights in Your Files. You acknowledge that
Dropbox does not have any obligation to monitor the Files or User Posts that are
uploaded, posted, submitted, linked to or otherwise transmitted using the Site
or Services, for any purpose and, as a result, is not responsible for the
accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, legality or applicability of the Files
or anything said, depicted or written by users in their User Posts, including
without limitation, any information obtained by using the Site or Services.
Dropbox does not endorse anything contained in the Files or User Posts or any
opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein and you agree to waive, and
hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have
against Dropbox with respect thereto.

Your Public Folder

While you own the content contained in Your Files, files placed in your public
folders are automatically available to other Dropbox users and to the general
public. By placing Your Files in your public folder, you hereby grant all other
Dropbox users and the public a non-exclusive, non-commercial, worldwide,
royalty-free, sublicensable, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use
and exploit Your Files in your public folder. In other words, a file in your
public folder can be used by anyone, for any purpose except commercial use. If
you do not want other people to be able to use Your Files in this manner, then
simply do not place Your Files in your public folder. By placing Your Files in
your public folder, you agree and acknowledge that Dropbox has no responsibility
or obligation to monitor or notify of you of any non-compliance related to the
license you have granted and that Dropbox has no responsibility to enforce or
police, or aid you in enforcing or policing, the terms of that license.

Your Shared Folder

While you own the content contained in Your Files, files placed in your shared
folders are available to those users to whom you grant access. By placing Your
Files in your shared folder, you agree and acknowledge that Dropbox has no
responsibility or obligation to monitor or notify of you of any non-compliance
related to the rights or license you may choose to grant to other users who have
access to your shared folders, if any, and that Dropbox has no responsibility to
enforce or police, or aid you in enforcing or policing, the terms of the
license(s) or permission(s) you have chosen to offer.

Your Responsibilities

You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents and permissions to grant the licenses that both your public and shared folders require, as described above. Please note that moving all or portions of Your Files from your public folders does not revoke the license granted to those individuals who previously accessed those files.

You should be aware that Files may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the Dropbox user whose folder (public or shared) that File resides in. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on the content(s) (either in whole or in part) of another user's shared folder unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by the rightful owner of that File, in a separate agreement.

You further acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining and protecting all data and information that is stored, retrieved or otherwise processed by the Site, Content, Files or Services.
