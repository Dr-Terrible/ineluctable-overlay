ineluctable-overlay
===================

Ineluctable Overlay offers a repository of Gentoo ebuilds made by me (Mauro
Toffanin, official Gentoo/FreeBSD Arch Tester) for projects that I am
interested in and are not yet into Portage.

Instructions for the overlay installation are provided here:
https://github.com/toffanin/ineluctable-overlay/wiki/Install

Feel free to fork and add more ebuilds.
