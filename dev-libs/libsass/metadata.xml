		Libsass is a C/C++ port of the Sass CSS precompiler. This library strives to be light, simple, and easy to build and integrate with a variety of platforms and languages.

		While libsass is a library primarily written in C++, it provides a simple C interface which should be used by most implementers. Libsass does not do much on its own without an implementer. This can be a command line tool, like sassc or a binding to your favorite programing language.
