		archivemount is a FUSE based file system for Unix variants, including Linux.
		Its purpose is to mount archives (i.e. tar, tar.gz, etc.) to a mount point
		where it can be read from or written to as with any other file system. This
		makes accessing the contents of the archive, which may be compressed,
		transparent to other programs.
